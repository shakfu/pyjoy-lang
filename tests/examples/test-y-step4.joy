(* Test y combinator: the issue is executing i on the constructed quotation *)
(* [[dup cons a b c] dup cons a b c] i should execute the body, which pushes
   [dup cons a b c], then executes dup cons a b c.
   But a, b, c are undefined. So this would fail. *)
(* Let me test with actual things that work *)

[1 2 +] [dup cons] swoncat dup cons i.
